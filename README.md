# Repertoire
## A Digital Music Library & Curriculum Planner

This web app allows band directors to house their entire music library digitally so they have the abilityt to track when pieces were performed throughout their career. By keeping notes on each piece as they program concerts, they create a log of import details that will help them program in the future.

## Project Details
This project focused on **building a Sinatra API backend** that uses
**Active Record** to access and persist data to a database

The project all utilizes a separate **React frontend** that interacts with the database via the API. That repo can be found [HERE][https://github.com/andrewasmit/repertoire_front]

## Getting Started

[**Fork and clone**][fork link] this repository to get started. Then, run
`bundle install` to install the gems.

## How To Use
Upon starting the application, a home page displays. You can then navigate to either your **Music Library**, which houses all the pieces of music you have at your disposal, or you can navigate to your **Concert Archives**, which houses the history of your ensemble's performances. 

# Music Library
Organize and digitize your music library so you know what you have and can easily access all the useful information you need when programming a concert. In rehearsals or post-performance, apply notes to pieces to help you remember important details about the piece when programming it in the future. 

# Concert Archives
Create an ongoing documentation of all the performances in your ensemble's history. Navigate throgh the years to see and remember who played what and when. This also helps organize to avoid repeat pieces for students so they are constantly exposed to new music.
